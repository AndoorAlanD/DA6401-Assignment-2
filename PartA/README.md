**Codes**
-----------------
**train_part_A.py** :- This python file contains the code for the Part A of assignment and can be called using command line arguments.

**train_part_A.ipynb** :- This the collab version of 'train_part_A.py' and in this you can find how to run this code by passing parameters from command line.

**Part_A_Question_1_3.ipynb** :- This file contains the code for the part A questions 1, 2 and 3 in report. This is the same code in train_part_A.py but in collab format.

**Part_A_Question_4.ipynb** :- This file contains the code for the part A question 4 in report. This is same as Part_A_Question_1_3.ipynb, the only difference is that here we are finding the test loss and acuracy as also printing the 3*10 Grid as required in the question.

Note: For Part_A_Question_1_3.ipynb and Part_A_Question_4.ipynb be sure to chnage the dataset location before running the code.
