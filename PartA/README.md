**Codes**
-----------------
**train.py** :- This code contains the whole code for the assignment and can be called using the following format(data_path is necessary in command line, as for other parameters there is default values provided):
 
!python train.py --data_path /dataset_location {--[other_parameters] [parameter_value]}


**Part_A_Question_1_3.ipynb** :- This file contains the code for the part A questions 1, 2 and 3 in report. This is the same code in train.py but in collab format.

**Part_A_Question_4.ipynb** :- This file contains the code for the part A question 4 in report. This is same as Part_A_Question_1_3.ipynb, the only difference is that here we are finding the test loss and acuracy as also printing the 3*10 Grid as required in the question.
